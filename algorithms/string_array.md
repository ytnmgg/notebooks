# [LeetCode] Two Sum
> Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
> You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
> Example:
> nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9, return [0, 1].
Create a map to store the index and the remaining value for that indexï¼š
```python
class Solution(object):
   def twoSum(self, nums, target):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :type target: int
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        maps = {}

        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i] in maps:
                return [maps[nums[i]], i]
            maps[target-nums[i]] = i

        return []
```
